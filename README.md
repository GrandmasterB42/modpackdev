# Vanilla Augmented

This is the Github Repo for the [Vanilla Augmented Modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/vanilla_augmented)<br>
A comprehensive description of the modpack can be found on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/vanilla_augmented)<br>

All my derived Modpacks can be found in the branches for now, if anyone has a better idea how to do that, let me know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rmUkjG8S6V)

This Modpack is created using the awesome packwiz tool ( [Github](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz) | [Documentation](https://packwiz.infra.link/) )
